Ingredients:
    Gala apples                   6
    can of ringed pineapple       16 ozs
    mayo                          heaping tbsp
    pecans, crushed               0.5 cups
    raisins                       1 box
    sour cream                    8 ozs

Cookware:
    large mixing bowl

Steps:
     1. Prepare a large bowl of ice-water to prevent the apples from browning during prep. Peel and core
        Gala apples, placing each into the ice-bath once skinned.

     2. Take each apple and cut into approximately 1/4 inch cubes, placing back in the ice bath once
        cubed. Set aside.

     3. Open and drain a can of ringed pineapple (reserve the juice!). Cut the pineapple rings into
        wedges and transfer to a large mixing bowl.

     4. To the same bowl, transfer over the cubed apples (taking care to not transfer over ice). Mix in
        raisins and pecans, crushed.
        [pecans, crushed: 0.5 cups; raisins: 1 box]
     5. To the bowl, add sour cream, mayo, and half of the reserved pineapple juice.

     6. Mix until well combined. If the dressing seems too runny, add more sour cream. If too thick, add
        more of the pineapple juice. Chill while waiting to serve.
