Ingredients:
    chile de arbol                3 handfulls
    garlic                        3 cloves
    olive oil                     some
    salt                          1 tbsp

Cookware:
    molcajete

Steps:
     1. In a pan, add a layer of olive oil and set to heat on medium/medium-high. 
        [olive oil: some]
     2. Slice the garlic into coins and fry in the oil. Constantly move them to avoid burning (they burn
        very easily). Fry for 2 minutes until they start to brown. Remove them and set aside.
        [garlic: 3 cloves]
     3. Add the chile de arbol to the pan and fry, moving constantly to avoid burning. Fry for 1 minute;
        they will plump back up and darken in color (do not allow them to turn black). Remove them and set
        aside, repeat until all the chilis have been fried. Turn the heat off and allow the oil in the pan
        to cool. 
        [chile de arbol: 3 handfulls]
     4. Transfer the garlic and chilies to a molcajete along with the salt. Grind until everything is
        roughly the same size as the chili seeds, using some of the oil from frying to assist in the
        grinding.
        [salt: 1 tbsp]
     5. Transfer the paste into a storage container along with any oil remaining from frying. Add more
        oil to fully cover chili paste and have a good layer of oil above the paste.

     6. Enjoy stirring and drizzling over food. The oil will be used up faster than the paste. You can
        continually replenish the oil to continue using salsa until the chili paste has also been used up.
