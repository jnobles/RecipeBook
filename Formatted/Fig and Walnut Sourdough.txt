    yield: 1 large loaf

Ingredients:
    All-Purpose flour             360 g
    dried cranberries             57 g
    dried figs, diced             75 g
    instant yeast                 0.25 tsp
    salt                          9 g
    sourdough starter             284 g
    walnuts, chopped              85 g
    water                         227 g

Cookware:
    large bowl
    baking stone

Steps:
     1. Into a large bowl weigh All-Purpose flour, sourdough starter, and water. Mix until just
        combined, then cover and allow to autolyze for 1 hour.
        [All-Purpose flour: 360 g; sourdough starter: 284 g; water: 227 g]
     2. After the autolyze, add in salt and instant yeast. Knead the dough until it is elastic and well
        integrated. Just before the kneading is done, mix in dried figs, diced or dried cranberries.
        [dried cranberries: 57 g; dried figs, diced: 75 g; instant yeast: 0.25 tsp; salt: 9 g]
     3. Once the dried fruit is integrated, fold walnuts, chopped into the dough. Cover the bowl and let
        rise at room temperature for roughly 60 minutes.

     4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface.

     5. Scoop up the edge of the dough with a dough scraper and bring it to the center, pressing down.
        Give the dough a quarter turn and repeat three or four times, turning the dough between each fold.
        You're strengthening the dough and pre-shaping it at the same time.

     6. Flour the banneton you want to use, or a tea towel places inside a bowl with a shape you find
        pleasing. Place the rounded dough into the banneton or bowl, bottom side up, over with plastic
        wrap, and refrigerate overnight.

     7. The next morning, preheat the oven to 450F with a baking stone in the lower third. Put an inch
        of water into a small skillet that can go into the oven. Place a piece of parchment on a baker's
        peel or the back of a baking sheet.

     8. Turn the loaf out of the banneton onto the parchment. Slash the top of the loaf, and slide the
        bread (paper and all) onto the stone in the oven. Spray the inside of the oven generously with
        water from a spray bottle and set a timer for 5 minutes.
        [–]
     9. Spray once more when the timer goes off and bake for another 35 minutes, until the center of the
        loaf reads 200F.
        [–]
    10. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack before slicing.

    11. Store leftover bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer
        storage.
