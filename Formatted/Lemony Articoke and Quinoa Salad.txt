    water                         1.8 cups

Cookware:
    fine wire mesh sieve
    pot

Steps:
     1. Rinse the quinoa well in a fine wire mesh sieve. Place the rinsed quinoa in a pot with water.
        Cover the pot with a lid, set the heat to high, and allow the water to come to a boil. Once it
        reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 15 minutes (lid on).

     2. While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the lemon garlic dressing. Zest the lemon, then squeeze the
        juice. Add the lemon juice and lemon zest to a bowl or jar along with olive oil, minced garlic,
        salt, and freshly cracked pepper. Whist the ingredients together until emulsified. Set the dressing
        aside.

     3. After the quinoa has cooked, spread it out into a casserole dish or other wide, shallow dish and
        refrigerate uncovered for about 15 minutes to cool.

     4. While the quinoa is cooling, prepare the est of the salad ingredients. Drain the artichoke
        hearts and roughly chop them into smaller pieces. Finely dice the red bell pepper. Roughly chop the
        parsley. Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Place the artichoke hearts, bell pepper, parsley, and
        chickpeas in a large bowl.

     5. Once the quinoa has cooled, add it to the bowl with the other salad ingredients. Toss gently to
        combine, then drizzle the lemon garlic dressing over-top. Toss again until everything is coated in
        dressing. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to 4-5 days.
