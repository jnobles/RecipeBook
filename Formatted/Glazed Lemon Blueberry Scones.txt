    descripton: These lemon blueberry scones are bursting with juicy blueberries and delicious lemon zing! They’re buttery and moist with crisp crumbly edges and soft flaky centers. Read through the recipe before beginning. You can skip the chilling for 15 minutes prior to baking, but I highly recommend it to prevent the scones from over-spreading.
    prep time: 30 minutes
    cook time: 25 minutes

Ingredients:
    baking powder                 2.5 tsp
    blueberries                   180 g
    butter                        115 g
    confectioner's sugar          120 g
    course sugar                  some
    egg                           1 large
    flour                         250 g
    granulated sugar              75 g
    heavy cream                   0.5 cups, 2 tbsp
    lemon juice                   3 tbsp
    lemon zest                    1 tbsp
    salt                          0.5 tsp
    vanilla extract               1.5 tsp

Cookware:
    large bowl
    box grater
    pastry cutter
    small bowl
    bench scraper
    oven
    large baking sheet
    parchment paper

Steps:
     1. Whisk flour, granulated sugar, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
        Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine using a pastry
        cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. Place in
        the refridgerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.
        [baking powder: 2.5 tsp; butter: 115 g; flour: 250 g; granulated sugar: 75 g; lemon zest: 1 tbsp;
        salt: 0.5 tsp]
     2. Whisk heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour
        mixture, add the blueberries, then mix together until everything appears moistened.

     3. Transfer to the counter and, with floured hands, work the dough into a ball as best you can. The
        dough will be sticky. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more
        tbsp. heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knice or bench scraper, cut into 8
        wedges.

     4. Brush scones with heavy cream and, for extra crunch, sprinkle with course sugar. (You can do
        this before or after refridgerating in the next step.)
        [course sugar: some; heavy cream: 2 tbsp]
     5. Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet and refridgerate for at least 15 minutes.
        Meanwhile, prehear the oven to 400F.

     6. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. After refridgerating,
        arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.

     7. Bake for approximately 22 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on
        top. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before topping with lemon icing.

     8. To make the icing: Whisk together confectioner's sugar and lemon juice. Drizzle over warm
        scones.
        [confectioner's sugar: 120 g; lemon juice: 3 tbsp]
     9. Leftover iced or un-iced scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refridgerator
        for 5 days.
