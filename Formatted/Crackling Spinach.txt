Ingredients:
    garlic                        2 tbsp
    ginger                        2 tbsp
    oil                           some
    powdered sugar                0.25 tsp
    red chili flakes              1 tsp
    salt                          0.25 tsp
    spinach                       16 ozs
    toasted sesame seeds          1 tsp

Cookware:
    spider

Steps:
     1. Take spinach, dry it well, and cut into thin, long strips (chiffonade).
        [spinach: 16 ozs]
     2. In a pot, add an oil of your choice (in a quantity for frying) and heat until you begin to see
        the surface of the oil ripple. Add the spinach, being careful as the water in the spinach will
        cause the oil to foam and pop as it is added. Fry the spinach for 2 minutes, stiring frequently.
        [oil: some]
     3. After the 2 minutes, remove the spinach using a spider and remove to a papertowel to drain
        excess oil. Continue for as many batches needed to fry your prepared spinach.

     4. Once finished frying the spinach, place garlic, minced, and ginger, finely chopped, into the
        spider and lower into the frying oil. Fry for 1 minute, moving constantly using a metal spoon to
        ensure even browning and prevent burning.
        [garlic: 2 tbsp; ginger: 2 tbsp]
     5. To a large bowl, add the fried spinach, garlic, and ginger. Add toasted sesame seeds, red chili
        flakes, salt, and powdered sugar. Toss well to mix. Optionally, add additional sesame seeds to top
        once combined.
