Ingredients:
    baking powder                 1 tsp
    salt                          0.25 tsp
    scallions                     2

    vegetable oil                 some
    water                         28 g

Cookware:
    medium bowl
    heavy-bottomed pan
    paper towel lined plate

Steps:
     1. In a medium bowl, combine sourdough starter, water, salt, and baking powder. Once this is well
        combined, mix in scallions (white parts chopped finely, green parts sliced about 1/4" wide).
        [baking powder: 1 tsp; salt: 0.25 tsp; scallions: 2; sourdough starter: 170 g; water: 28 g]
     2. Set a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Pur in enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the
        pan 1/8" deep. Allow it to heat until you see the surface ripple.
        [vegetable oil: some]
     3. Spoon a heaping 2 tbsp. batter into the hot pan. Cook for about 1 minute, until the bottom is
        golden brown. Flip and cook for an additional approximately 45 seconds and remove to a paper towel
        lined plate.
