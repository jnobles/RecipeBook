     2. In a skillet, melt butter, salted over medium-low heat, along with a olive oil. Once the butter
        is melted, add in the whole garlic cloves and cook, moving frequently. As the garlic cooks, it will
        soften. Once possible, use a fork or other tool to smash the garlic as it continues to cook. Cook
        until the garlic is nicely browned along with the butter.
