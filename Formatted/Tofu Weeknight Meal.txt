Ingredients:
    black vinegar                 some
    chili powder                  1 tbsp
    green onion                   2 bulbs
    oil                           4 tbsp
    silken extra-firm tofu        1 block
    soy sauce                     some
    szechwan peppercorns          2 tsp

Steps:
     1. Take silken extra-firm tofu and pat dry to remove excess packing water. Transfer to a heat-safe
        dish (preferably a shallow bowl as you will be adding a fair amount of liquid).
        [silken extra-firm tofu: 1 block]
     2. Chop the green part of roughly green onion on a bias and place on the center of the dried block
        of tofu. Top with roughly chili powder and freshly ground szechwan peppercorns.
        [chili powder: 1 tbsp; green onion: 2 bulbs; szechwan peppercorns: 2 tsp]
     3. In a pan, heat up oil  until it just begins to smoke. Carefully pour this oil over-top the tofu
        and spices.
        [oil: 4 tbsp]
     4. Finish topping with soy sauce and black vinegar to taste. Serve with rice, noodles, or whatever
        sides you have available.
