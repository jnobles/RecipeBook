Put @olive oil{some} to heat over a medium flame in a large pan.  Add in @ground beef{1%lb} to cook, moving occasionally.

While the ground beef is cooking, dice @prunes{12} and add to the beef along with @almonds, slivered{4%oz}.  Cook until nearly finished (a small amount of pink should still be visible).

Add @consome de pollo{} to taste, then transfer to the cavity of a turkey in the last hour of baking.  The meat will finish cooking along with the turkey.
