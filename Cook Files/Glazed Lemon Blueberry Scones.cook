>> description: These lemon blueberry scones are bursting with juicy blueberries and delicious lemon zing! Theyâ€™re buttery and moist with crisp crumbly edges and soft flaky centers. Read through the recipe before beginning. You can skip the chilling for 15 minutes prior to baking, but I highly recommend it to prevent the scones from over-spreading.

Whisk @flour{250%g}, @granulated sugar{75%g}, @lemon zest{1%tbsp}, @baking powder{5/2%tsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp} together in a #large bowl{}.  Grate the frozen @butter{115%g} using a #box grater{}.  Add it to the flour mixture and combine using a #pastry cutter{}, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs.  Place in the refridgerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.

Whisk @heavy cream{1/2%cup}, the @egg{1%large}, and @vanilla extract{3/2%tsp} together in a #small bowl{}.  Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the @blueberries{180%g}, then mix together until everything appears moistened.

Transfer to the counter and, with floured hands, work the dough into a ball as best you can.  The dough will be sticky.  If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.  If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more tbsp. heavy cream.  Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knice or #bench scraper{}, cut into 8 wedges.

Brush scones with @heavy cream{2%tbsp} and, for extra crunch, sprinkle with @course sugar{}.  (You can do this before or after refridgerating in the next step.)

Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet and refridgerate for at least ~{15%minutes}.  Meanwhile, prehear the #oven{} to 400F.

Line a #large baking sheet{} with #parchment paper{} or a silicone baking mat.  After refridgerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake for approximately ~{22%minutes}, or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top.  Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before topping with lemon icing.

To make the icing: Whisk together @confectioner's sugar{120%g} and @lemon juice{3%tbsp}.  Drizzle over warm scones.

Leftover iced or un-iced scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refridgerator for 5 days.
