Fill a bowl with warm water and transfer the @cocktail shrimp, cooked{1%lb) to the water to defrost.

While the shrimp is defrosting, wash @potatos{6%large} and set to boil in a large pot of water.  Cook until they are soft enough to pierce easily with a fork.  Take care not to overcook them or they will become mushy.  Once the potatos are cooked, allow them to cool.  Remove the skins, cut them into bite-sized cubes, and transfer into a bowl.

Wash and slice @celery sticks{3} and transfer into the bowl with the potatos.  Also transfer in the defrosted shrimp, @mayo{6%oz}, @sour cream{6%oz}, and the @lime juice{1%lime}.  Mix until well combined, and add @salt{} and @white pepper{} to taste{}.

Chill until ready to serve and serve cold.
