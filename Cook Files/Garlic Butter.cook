Peel @garlic cloves{2%heads} and set aside.

In a #skillet{}, melt @butter, salted{0.5%stick} over medium-low heat, along with a @olive oil{drizzle}.  Once the butter is melted, add in the whole garlic cloves and cook, moving frequently.  As the garlic cooks, it will soften.  Once possible, use a fork or other tool to smash the garlic as it continues to cook.  Cook until the garlic is nicely browned along with the butter.

Either use immediately, or transfer to a small container to cool for use later.
